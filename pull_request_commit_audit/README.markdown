# Commit Pull Request Audit
Run this script providing 1) you GitHub API oauth token and 2) your
GitHub owner / repo name and you'll be able to see all commits that were
merged directly without going through a pull request first.

## Why?
Change management compliance will more often than not require changed to
be approved by others before going to production. This tool will give
you the commits that didn't follow that path.
